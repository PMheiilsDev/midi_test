Info about midi feedback about the sliders it seams like the position of the slider in software can not be sent by voicemeeter (wait for email responce)

It does work to send the state of a button in macro buttons to the device see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yUt_3Bsciw 

Basically:
System.SendMidi( "out1", "data", 90, 1, 7f/0 ); 
 - here the out1 might represent which device it is sent to



Add a function that can decode midi measages
