
The solution was to activate feedback by pressing the F button in midi mapping in voicemeeter


Add a function that can decode midi measages 

    there seems to be a problem of voicemeeter not sending data for the buttons in all cases like 
    also the led state and the button state seem to get mixed up after using both the software and the hardware to change the state 

    i believe there to be no fix when still using the state feature 
        rising edge sends the data and toggles the state from 0 to 127 

        seems like FF mode might work
